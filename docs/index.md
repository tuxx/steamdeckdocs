This website is a community made project where anyone can submit new articles. If you would like to contribute please checkout our [github repository](https://github.com/tuxx/steamdeckdocs). Anyone can add an issue or send a pull request to add pages to this website.

Every page on this website has been made with [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) markup language. For instance if you would like to see how we made this page, checkout this [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tuxx/steamdeckdocs/master/docs/index.md)

This project is still very much a Work In Progress. Currently we are working on:

* ~~Deploying the website through github (i'm doing it manually as of now)~~
* Add steamdeck icon emoji's, so you can easily use the steamdeck icons in the documentation. (For example: :button-a: or :button-steam: will render an icon)
* Creating a styleguide so that the documentation will look uniform
* Adding more documentation

# steamdeckdocs
Community driven markdown documentation for the steamdeck that will generate static html on https://steamdeckdocs.org.

# TODO
- Pipelines for deploying website
- Where to store images?
- Add steamdeck icons that you can easily use in the markdown
- Create a styleguide so we will have somewhat unified docs
- Add [header enumerating plugin](https://github.com/timvink/mkdocs-enumerate-headings-plugin)
- Create more documentation
